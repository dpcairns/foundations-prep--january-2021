### Make a wireframe 

1) Design a `restaurants` page for a yelp-like site. Each restaurant should be a container, and in that container there should be a picture, a category (Chinese, Thai, etc), a name, and a list of the top 3 dishes.
1) Notice we have a list inside a list here. Each of these favorite DISHES should have a name, a price, and an image.
1) Add your design to your repo. ACP.
BONUS) Add reviews for each dish. This is a list inside a list inside a list! Each review should have a user, a blurb, and a number of stars.

### Build out your design!

1) Use semantic html and descriptive class names in your css to implement your design using nested `ul` and `li`. ACP!
