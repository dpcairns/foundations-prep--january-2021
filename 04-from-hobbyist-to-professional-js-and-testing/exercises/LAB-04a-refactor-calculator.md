Lab 04a: Calculator Refactor
===

With a partner or in a mob, refactor your calculator app.

- Turn your math operations into functions in a separate file to be imported
- Add tests with at least 3 test cases per function to verify that the functions return what you _expect_ them to return
- Refactor names of things to clarify the intent and make your code generally more readable to other developers.
