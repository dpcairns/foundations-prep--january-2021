Create the following structure inside your `~/alchemy` directory (folder).

## Step 0

(If you don't have a `~/alchemy` directory, go make one!)

## Step 1

Make directories with `mkdir`, `cd` and `pwd`

```
~
    |
    +- alchemy
        |
        +- foundations-empty
        |
        +- foundations-files
        |
        +- foundations-prep
        |
        +- foundations-rename-me
            |
            +-foundations-sub-directory
```

## Step 2

Creating files with `echo`

```
~
    |
    +- alchemy
        |
        +- foundations-empty
        |
        +- foundations-files
            |
            +- hello-world.txt  "hello world"
            |
            +- foo-bar.txt  "if foo then bar"
        |
        +- foundations-one
        |
        +- foundations-prep
            |
            +-foundations-sub-directory

```

## Step 3

Moving files with `mv`

```
~
    |
    +- alchemy
        |
        +- foundations-empty
            |
            +- hello-world.txt  "hello world"
            |
            +- foo-bar.txt  "if foo then bar"
        
        +- foundations-files
        |
        +- foundations-one
        |
        +- foundations-prep
            |
            +-foundations-sub-directory

```


## Step 4

Renaming with `mv`

```
~
    |
    +- alchemy
        |
        +- foundations-full
            |
            +- hello-world.txt  "hello world"
            |
            +- foo-bar.txt  "if foo then bar"
        |
        +- foundations-files
        |
        +- foundations-one
        |
        +- foundations-prep
            |
            +-foundations-sub-directory

```

## Step 5

Remove empty directory with `rmdir`

```
~
    |
    +- alchemy
        |
        +- foundations-full
            |
            +- hello-world.txt  "hello world"
            |
            +- foo-bar.txt  "if foo then bar"
        
        +- foundations-one
        |
        +- foundations-prep
            |
            +-foundations-sub-directory
```

## Step 6

Remove the foundations-full directory and its contents with `rm -rf`

```
~
    |
    +- alchemy
        |        
        +- foundations-one
        |
        +- foundations-prep
            |
            +-foundations-sub-directory

```
