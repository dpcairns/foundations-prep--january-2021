## Terminal Commands and Github Lab

1) Create a repo with a README.md on Github
1) Clone your repo on the command line
1) `cd` into your repo from the command line
1) `pwd` to make sure you're in the right directory
1) From the command line, once you're in your repo, create a file tree that looks like this:
```
    src
     |__assets
        |__style.css
        |__app.js
     |__index.html
    README.md
    greeting.md
```
1) From the command line, add the line 'Hello there!' to your `greeting.md` file
1) If it's working time to commit! ACP your code and push it to your master branch!
1) From the command line `code .` your repo.
1) Use VSCode to write in `README.md`. Add to this file a list of terminal commands that you used to clone this repo and create all of the files and directories in it. Use code block syntax and `1)` for numbered bullets in `README.md`, like so:
```console
1) First, you should make a repo with a README.me
1) Then, you should `git clone` that repo, using the URL from the Clond button 
1) Then, you should `cd /path/to/whatever/` . . . 
etc, etc, etc,
 ``` 
11) ACP your code and push it to your master branch!
12) In README.md, also add (random, arbitrary) examples of a bullet list, a table, bold, italicized, h1, h2, and h3 text.
13) ACP your code (again!) and push it to your master branch (again)!
14) Put the link to the repo in the canvas submission.
